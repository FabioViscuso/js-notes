## WHAT'S THIS

These are live notes, taken on actual .js files to allow for editing and testing.
They're useful as a refresher and/or a safe environment to test stuff out.
You will find included the possibility to run prompt() inside the Node.js REPL.

## PREREQUISITES

-   To run .js files outside of a browser, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
-   A basic familiarity with the command line and its commands, such as cd, ls, mkdir

## HOW TO USE THIS

-   Open the whole js-notes folder in your preferred editor
-   To run a file, open a terminal pointing to the js-notes folder and type: node filename.js

Example: node notes-functions.js will run all the code written in that file,
along with prompts and console logs

## TIPS

-   If after a long editing/hacking session on a file you wish to return to its default state,
    just discard changes using git
-   If you're using Prettier, when adding/renaming a file make sure to include it to the .prettierignore
    file. This way you'll be in control of the formatting of these files (recommended)
